# Sportsmen

All neccessary files for loading fonts and images are included in the Sportsmen folder you should have gotten a download link for on dropbox.  These files are required to be inside your /user/documents/visualstudio2010/projects/sportsmen/sportsmen folder in order not to crash the game when it tries to load assets that don't exist.  Other than that, if you have all of the files on this repository compiled together as I do the game should run fine.  If you get bored please attempt to break anything you can get your hands on.  I've tried to make most of the GUI as intuitive as possible, but if the number of glitches during development are any indicator, there are plenty more problems to find.  On another note, I have decided to include the debug folder as well as the two project files from Visual Studio in the Sportsmen folder.  If you wish, you may go into your documents, make a sportsmen folder, make another sportsmen folder inside of that, and copy all of the contents of my folder inside.  After doing so you should already have the build set up and ready for compilation if it works the way I think it does; this will prevent the extra work of having to copy and paste every file over every time you want to build the game yourself
