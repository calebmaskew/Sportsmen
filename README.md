# Sportsmen

All neccessary files for loading fonts and images are included in the Sportsmen folder you should have gotten a download link for on dropbox.  These files are required to be inside your /user/documents/visualstudio2010/projects/sportsmen/sportsmen folder in order not to crash the game when it tries to load assets that don't exist.  Other than that, if you have all of the files on this repository compiled together as I do the game should run fine.  If you get bored please attempt to break anything you can get your hands on.  I've tried to make most of the GUI as intuitive as possible, but if the number of glitches during development are any indicator, there are plenty more problems to find.  

Most Recently Implemented:
	Added in a confirmation message box for purchasing upgrades.  Reformatted guild
	display screen to be cleaner and easier to read.  Added text wrapping function
	so that the descriptions for the cities can be displayed on the guild screen
	correctly.  Integrated and slightly cleaned up the mission generator code.  
	This source code doesn't currently do anything with it, but it's ready and waiting.
